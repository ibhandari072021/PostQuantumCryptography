# Dependency Verification

Each PQC library version used in this project is pinned and verified via checksum against the official repository.  
Checksums are recorded in SBOM.txt for audit purposes.  

Update Process:  
1. Fetch updated library code or binaries from official source.  
2. Verify checksum matches authorized version.  
3. Update SBOM.txt and document changes in CHANGELOG.md.  
4. Notify governance board via docs/cscrm_note.md of dependency update status.
